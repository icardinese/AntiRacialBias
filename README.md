# AntiRacialBias

Rapid racial fairness identifier and corrector by taking a dataset of the Recidivism and Violent Recidivism Dataset COMPAS from Pro Publica and train it in the XGBOOST model to see the results. Disparities in result within different racial groups will be mitigated by examining FPR (False Positive Rates) and FNR (False Negative Rates) across different racial groups. Then equalized odds will be applied to equalize the false positive rates across racial groups. The results are displayed in a nice easy-to-use website where COMPAS like documents can be uploaded and factors can be fed into the model for prediction and a pdf report that can be taken to courst for mroe equitable decisions. This is necessary to reduce the racial divide and to create a more accurate algorithm based on a greater wealth of data and a multi-model solution.
